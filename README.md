osx-terminal-title
==============

a simple script to change the os-x terminal title

### Installation:

Just copy the script to your favorite ```$PATH``` bin dir (make sure you have execute permission).

If you're [brewing](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew "brewing") like me: ```cp title /usr/local/bin```
if not: ```sudo cp title /usr/bin```
